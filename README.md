# What is rehash?

rehash is a password manager that generates your passwords on the fly based on your master password, the site you're saving the password for and your username.

This allows you to generate a seemingly random password for every site, while also being able to access that same password from other devices without having to upload it into the cloud.

rehash is based on [PwdHash](https://crypto.stanford.edu/PwdHash/), an approach to eliminate password reuse that was published at Stanford University. It extends on this approach and packages it in a beautiful, modern web application.

# How does it work?

Your password is generated using a cryptographic hash function, a one-way mapping from any input data to a unique identifier of that data.

Here are some examples:

|           Password           |      Site      | Username           | Generated Password               |
| :--------------------------: | :------------: | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |

|           hunter2            | www.google.com | janedoe2@gmail.com | Dzy7WnDSccyfYlQ1D5zZa3ug+2T/6q/L |

It is ensured that there is no computationally feasible way to get from the output (generated password) of the hash function to the input (password, site and username).

rehash uses the [Argon2id](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) function to generate the hash.

# Is rehash for me?

A cloud password manager is the way to go for most intents and purposes. I highly recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).

The major drawbacks of rehash are:

- Changing the master password changes all your passwords.
- Changing a single password is difficult (password generations exist, but have to be remembered)
- It is not as secure as a password manager with truly randomly generated passwords.

rehash tries to fit the niche of people who:

- Do not want their passwords stored in the cloud
- Yet use many different devices, so using a traditional offline password manager like [KeePass](https://keepassxc.org/) is unviable
